Four score and seven years ago our

dedicated to the proposition that
all men are created equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war,
testing whether that nation, or
any nation so conceived and so dedicated,
can long endure. We are met on
a great battle-field of that war. We have
come to dedicate a portion of that
field, as a final resting place for those
who here gave their lives that that
nation might live. It is altogether
fitting and proper that we should do this.
